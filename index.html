			<h2>Hi, I'm Eric!</h2>
			<p>I'm a Canadian computer enthusiast with a passion for operating 
			systems. A lot of my free time is spent playing around with a select 
			few operating systems and trying to learn from them. I hope to use 
			this knowledge to make my own operating system one day.
			<br />
			<br />
			I currently have a couple projects on the go. The biggest one is probably the 
			unamed package manager I'm working on. You can find more info on it and any 
			other projects of mine in the "Projects" section of this website.

		<div class="history">
			<h2> A Little History</h2>
			<p>I've been interested in computers for most of my life. I started 
			out with playing computer games at the age of 5. Strategy and Racing games
			were my absolute  favourites. Five years later I was trying to make my own games 
			on some free development platforms.
			<br />
			<br />
			When I was around 13 years old I started using Linux, and it completely
			opened up my eyes to a whole new side of computers. I was obsessed with 
			trying out every Linux distribution that had something unique to offer. 
			That eventually led me the BSDs a year later and other smaller operating 
			systems.
			<br />
			<br />
			These days I don't constantly switch operating systems and I've settled with 
			FreeBSD one my main computer, NetBSD on a Raspberry Pi, and Alpine Linux on an 
			old toaster of a computer. I also do run a few other distributions and operating 
			systems in virtual machines to play with.</p>
