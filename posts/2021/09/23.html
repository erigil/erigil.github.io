			<h1>2021-09-23: Website Online & Future Plans</h1>
			<h2> Website is finally up!</h2>
			<p>It took a while, but i finally have my website online. It's all 
			made with raw HTMl and CSS. Not sure if it was smart to do it this way 
			but it works. I don't think it's done or ever will be for that matter--I'm 
			always making tweaks/adjustments to my projects, and  this website 
			is no different. I don't plan on doing anything crazy since I would 
			like it to remain lightweight and I do like the simple design.</p>
		
			<h2>So what's next?</h2>
			<p>Recently I switched my main desktop OS to FreeBSD; It's mostly 
			running smoothly but I do have some kinks to work out yet. Once I 
			finish that I will create a post about that journey, and hopefully 
			provide some useful information for people looking to run FreeBSD 
			on their desktops.
			<br />
			<br />
			The package manager is the big project I'm working on. No release date 
			for it yet, (It's not easy to make) but keep an eye out. I will probably 
			post some progress updates.
			<br />
			<br />
			I will also continue to learn Rust when I'm not working on the package manager. 
			Funny thing is, this will be the first compiled programming language that 
			I will code my own programs with. I can find my way around C and C++; I 
			can't create a program from scratch with them though. I never really bothered 
			to take the time and fully learn either of them, and I'm not sure why. 
			Now that Rust has been out for a while and is stable I'll mostly focus on that 
			instead.
