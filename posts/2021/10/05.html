			<h1>2021-10-05: My Experience With Getting FreeBSD to Run On My Desktop</h1>
			<h2>Intro</h2>
			<p>I first started using FreeBSD back in 2014; mostly for home servers and 
			various projects. I did run it on my laptop for a little bit back then, but it 
			had issues with my hardware. I ended sticking with Linux on my laptop.
			Fast forward to today, I now have FreeBSD running on my desktop and most of the 
			programs I use work really well. The only exceptions are a few alternatives that I 
			decided to use and a game that just won't work.</p>
			
			<h2>Hardware & First Steps</h2>
			
			<p>I installed FreeBSD on a computer with 2x 8GB DDR4 RAM @ 3200mhz Ryzen 5 2600X, 
			Radeon RX 580, 256GB SSD, 1TB HDD @ 7200rpm, ASRock B450 Pro4 Motherboard 
			and a Wi-Fi card that I don't remember the name of but it uses an unsupported 
			Realtek chipset.
			<br />
			<br />
			I decided to go with FreeBSD 13 RELEASE because I very much prefer point releases 
			and stability over rolling-release or bleeding edge. As for the filesystem I went 
			wiuth Encrypted ZFS. I have no reason to use UFS over ZFS and I really like what 
			ZFS offers. The installation process went as expected, painless with the only 
			issue being an unsupported Wi-Fi card.</p>
			
			<h2>Where The Issues Begin</h2>
			<p>My first goal was to get XFCE and LightDM up and running smoothly. Simple enoughr right? 
			Not so much. While I was able to install XFCE and drm-kmod/amdgpu, I got a kernel 
			panic when I rebooted my computer. Turns out there's an issue with the AMDGPU drivers 
			and UEFI. Thankfully the fix is pretty simple, I just needed to add the following to 
			/boot/loader.conf:</p>
			
			<div class="code">
				<p>hw.syscons.disable=1</p>
			</div>
			
			<p>After that I was able to boot into LightDM and log into XFCE. However, I ran into 
			another problem. Really bad stuttering every 5-10 seconds. I had this issue a yearor so ago when 
			trying to run FreeBSD on my desktop, but I was unable to find an answer then. Thankfully 
			this time I was able to find a solution, although I'm not sure why it works. It also seems that 
			<a href="https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/ryzen-micro-stutter-fix.81483/">others</a> 
			have/had this issue too. Anyway just add the follwing to your /etc/sysctl.conf to fix it:</p>
			
			<div class="code">
				<p>kern.sched.steal_thresh=1</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2> Smooth Sailing... For Now</h2>
			
			<p>Once those issues were resolved, I was back on track. Spent some time configure my desktop 
			and installed most of the programs/software that I use Also had to use some alternatives. 
			lot's of them do require a little  extra configuration though. It's just adding one or two 
			lines to /etc/rc.conf, I expected that.
			<br />
			<br />
			Next up was Linux compatibility, and I was pleasantly surprised with how easy it was. All I 
			needed to do was mount a few directories, install some packages, and enable some services. A few Linux 
			programs were already in the ports/packages repository and it was just a matter of installing them. 
			That's not to say all Linux software is that simple to run. If it's not in the ports you'll have to manually 
			install it on your system and copy the apropriate libraries from a Linux system to your FreeBSD installation. You 
			could also experiment with running Linux Jails but that's a lot more work for the intial setup. It does however 
			tie nicely to my next topic...
			<br />
			<br />
			Jails! How I love Jails, so useful and dead simple to use with the right tools. The default method of installing 
			Jails can be a pain. Thankfully there's a lot of tools out there to make it easier. I use <a href="https://bastillebsd.org/">Bastille</a> 
			myself, because it has ZFS support, Dynamic IP support, and it's as painless as it gets. You can also create Linux 
			Jails with it fairly easily, which I plan on doing at some point. Anyway, I installed a few Jails and it went well.</p>
			
			<h2>Another Issue!</h2>
			<p>WINE, has been one huge pain. I wanted to  install WINE so I could play a game I like. Downloaded 
			and installed and ran the executable. Main menu pops up, and crashed the second I clicked play. Not 
			a problem I remembered I needed DXVK too. I Installed it and went to play the game. Turns out 
			WINE Stable on FreeBSD isn't complied with DXVK support. WINE Devel is though so I switched to 
			that. Wine Devel is totally broken on FreeBSD. I tried everything I could to get it to work but 
			it refused. I was really regretting using packages instead of ports. I could hjave just compiled 
			WINE Stable with DXVK support. Needless to say I never got that game working.</p>
			
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Overall FreeBSD is a great OS and probably my favourite. Its rock solid lightweight, and full of features. 
			However, its still a little rough when it comes to desktop use (As explained in this post). While hardware 
			support has drastically improved over the years, there's still some common hardware that's just unsupported. 
			Also don't expect to be playing a lot of games on it either. While there are efforts to bring Steam and 
			Proton to it, most of your games probably won't work on it. 
			<br />
			<br />
			Would I reccomend FreeBSD on the desktop? For the average person, no. For people who more tech savy; 
			sure, why not? Just expect some issues.</p>
