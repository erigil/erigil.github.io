			<h1>2022-05-03: Updates to quicced and Progress on sqpkg</h1>
			<h2>quicced</h2>
			<p>Within the past couple of days I made some updates to quicced. There is now a 
			proper error handling system;I adjusted the formatting a bit too. Since I tested 
			thoroughly before pushing it to the unstable branch, I decided to merge "unstable" 
			with "main".
			<br />
			<br />
			Currently I'm working on support for Jails; I have bsdinstall mostly done. I plan 
			on adding support for Bastille, iocage, and ezjail too. After those are complete I 
			hope to add bhyve with PCI passthrough.</p>
			
			<h2>sqpkg</h2>
			
			<p>I'm slowly making progress on sqpkg; it's actually in a very basic working state. 
			I don't feel that it's at a point where it can be publicly released though. It's still 
			missibg some basic features like dependency downloads, file verification, complete 
			package configs, etc. I'm not sure exactly when the first public release will arrive, 
			but I hope it will be sometime late this year to mid next year. No promises though.</p>
